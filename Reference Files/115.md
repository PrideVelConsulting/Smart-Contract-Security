---

### **Category Type** : MEDIUM/HIGH


### **Explanation** : 
Griefing is a type of attack often performed in video games, where a malicious user plays a game in an unintended way to bother other players, aka trolling.
This type of attack is also used to prevent transactions from being performed as intended.

This attack can be done on contracts which accept data and use it in a subcall on another contract.
This method is often used in multisignature wallets as well as transaction relayers.
If the subcall fails, either the whole transaction is reverted or execution is continued.
