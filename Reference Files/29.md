##  Common cases >> Rare cases


---

### **Category Type** : GAS OPTIMIZATION


### **Explanation** : 

 One should optimize for common cases. Optimizing for rare cases can increase gas costs for all other cases. For   example, skipping balance update in case of 0 amount transfer.
 As 0 amount transfer is not common, it doesn't make sense to add the cost of one condition for all other cases.
However, if the case is common, like transfer in case of infinite allowance, one should do it.
