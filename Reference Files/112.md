##  Block stuffing  



   



---

### **Category Type** : MEDIUM/HIGH


### **Explanation** : 

In some situations, your contract can be attacked with a block gas limit even if you don’t loop through an array of unspecified length. An attacker can fill several blocks before a transaction can be processed by using a sufficiently high gas price.
This attack is done by issuing several transactions at a very high gas price. If the gas price is high enough and the transactions consume enough gas, they can fill entire blocks and prevent other transactions from being processed.
Ethereum transactions require the sender to pay gas to disincentivize spam attacks, but in some situations, there can be enough incentive to go through with such an attack. For example, a block stuffing attack was used on a gambling Dapp, Fomo3D. The app had a countdown timer, and users could win a jackpot by being the last to purchase a key — except every time a user bought a key, the timer would be extended. An attacker bought a key then stuffed the next 13 blocks in a row so they could win the jackpot.
To prevent such attacks from occurring, it’s important to carefully consider whether it’s safe to incorporate time-based actions in your application.
