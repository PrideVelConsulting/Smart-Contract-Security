##  Contract and Library Naming Convention


---

### **Category Type** : QUALITY ASSURANCE / NON-CRITICAL


### **Explanation** : 

 * Contracts and libraries should be named using the CapWords style. Examples: SimpleToken,    SmartBank, CertificateHashRepository, Player, Congress, Owned.

* Contract and library names should also match their filenames.

* If a contract file includes multiple contracts and/or libraries, then the filename should match the core contract. This is not recommended however if it can be avoided.
    
 * If the contract name is Congress and the library name is Owned, then their associated filenames should be Congress.sol and Owned.sol.
