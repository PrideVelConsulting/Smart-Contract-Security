##   Danger “while” loop


   



---

### **Category Type** : QUALITY ASSURANCE / NON-CRITICAL


### **Explanation** : 

For loops are more associated with iterations. While loop instead are more associated with repetitive tasks. Such tasks could potentially be infinite if the while loop body never affects the condition initially checked.

Therefore, they should be used with care.

Because it is inside the exactInput() function, which is an external function, a DOS attack can create spam and break the function, especially in shallow liquidity.
