## 10) Use Short-Circuiting rules to your advantage 


---

### **Category Type** : GAS OPTIMIZATION


### **Explanation** :

When using logical disjunction (||), logical conjunction (&&), make sure to order your functions correctly for optimal gas usage.
     In logical disjunction (OR), if the first function resolves to true, the second one won’t be executed and hence save you gas.
     In logical disjunction (AND), if the first function evaluates to false, the next function won’t be evaluated.
     Therefore, you should order your functions accordingly in your solidity code to reduce the probability of needing to evaluate the second function. 

For || and && operators, the second case is not checked if the first case gives the result of the logical expression.  Put the lower-cost expression first so the higher-cost expression may be skipped (short-circuit).




```javascript

 //Unoptimized:
    
     case 1: 100 gas
     case 2: 50 gas

 	if(case1 && case2) revert
 	if(case1 || case2) revert
    
  // Optimized:
    if(case2 && case1) revert
 	if(case2 || case1) revert
	

```
