##  Using private rather than public for constants, saves gas


---

### **Category Type** : GAS OPTIMIZATION


### **Explanation** :


 If needed, the values can be read from the verified contract source code,
or if there are multiple values there can be a single getter function that returns a tuple of the values of all currently-public constants.
Saves 3406-3606 gas in deployment gas due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata,
not having to store the bytes of the value outside of where it's used, and not adding another entry to the method ID table
  


```javascript

  // Unoptimized 
   uint256 public constant MULTISIG_LIMIT = 10;
   
   //Optimized
   uint256 private constant MULTISIG_LIMIT = 10;


```
