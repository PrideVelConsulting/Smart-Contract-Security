## 8)  Use Custom Errors


---

### **Category Type** : GAS OPTIMIZATION


### **Explanation** :

Instead of using error strings, to reduce deployment and runtime cost, you should use Custom Errors. This would save both deployment and runtime cost.



```javascript

//Unoptimized:

function add(uint256 _amount) public {
	require(msg.sender == owner, "unauthorized");
	total += _amount;
}


//Optimized:

error Unauthorized(address caller);

function add(uint256 _amount) public {
	if (msg.sender != owner)
    	revert Unauthorized(msg.sender);

	total += _amount;
}
	

```
