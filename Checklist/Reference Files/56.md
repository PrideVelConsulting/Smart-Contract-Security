## 56) Reentrancy Attack



---

### **Category Type** : MEDIUM/HIGH


### **Explanation** : 

A reentrancy attack is a type of vulnerability in smart contracts that allows an attacker to repeatedly call back into the same contract before the previous execution completes. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially enable the attacker to drain funds or manipulate the contract's state.

To better understand how a reentrancy attack works, let's consider a simplified example in Solidity:


```javascript

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VulnerableContract {
    mapping(address => uint256) private balances;

    function withdraw(uint256 _amount) public {
        uint256 balance = balances[msg.sender];
        require(balance >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");

        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");

        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }
}



```

In this vulnerable contract, users can deposit funds into their account and then initiate a withdrawal. The contract maintains a mapping of balances for each user. However, the contract does not update the user's balance before transferring funds, leaving it susceptible to a reentrancy attack.

**Here's an overview of how an attacker can exploit this vulnerability:**

    1. The attacker deploys a malicious contract and sets up a fallback function to be executed when the vulnerable contract transfers funds.
    2. The attacker calls the vulnerable contract's withdraw function, initiating a transfer of funds to their malicious contract.
    3. At this point, the fallback function of the attacker's contract is triggered, and it recursively calls back into the vulnerable contract's withdraw function.
    4. Since the vulnerable contract's balance is not updated before the recursive call, the attacker can repeatedly drain the contract's funds before the original withdrawal completes.

**To prevent reentrancy attacks, Solidity provides a mechanism called the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern. Here's an updated version of the contract with the necessary safeguards:**

```javascript

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SecureContract {
    mapping(address => uint256) private balances;
    mapping(address => bool) private inWithdrawal;

    function withdraw(uint256 _amount) public {
        require(!inWithdrawal[msg.sender], "Withdrawal in progress");
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");

        inWithdrawal[msg.sender] = true;  // Mark the sender as in withdrawal

        uint256 balance = balances[msg.sender];
        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;

        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");

        inWithdrawal[msg.sender] = false;  // Reset the withdrawal status
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }
}


```


In the updated contract, we introduce the inWithdrawal mapping to keep track of whether a withdrawal is currently in progress for a particular user. Here's how this prevents reentrancy attacks:

    1. When a user initiates a withdrawal, the contract checks if they are already in the withdrawal process. If so, it throws an exception.
    2. The contract updates the inWithdrawal status to indicate that a withdrawal is in progress for that user.
    3. The contract deducts the requested withdrawal amount from the user's balance.
    4. The contract then transfers the funds to the user.
    5. Finally, the contract resets the inWithdrawal status for that user.

By implementing the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern and properly managing the state, the contract ensures that an attacker cannot recursively call the withdraw function and manipulate the contract's funds.
