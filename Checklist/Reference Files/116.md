##  Reentrancy 


   



---

### **Category Type** : MEDIUM/HIGH


### **Explanation** : 

Reentrancy is an attack that can occur when a bug in a contract function can allow a function interaction to proceed multiple times when it should otherwise be prohibited.
This can be used to drain funds from a smart contract if used maliciously. In fact, reentrancy was the attack vector used in the DAO hack.
