## 20) Less than or equal to” (<=) is more expensive than just “less than” (<)


---

### **Category Type** : GAS OPTIMIZATION


### **Explanation** : 

If checking if something is less than or equal to, or greater than or equal to, then the EVM needs to do more opcodes.
 So it is cheaper to check just < or >, instead of <= or >=.

Example below shows it with greater than or equal to, but it works both ways!
    
```javascript

    pragma solidity >=0.8.4;

	contract Example {
 
 	// 21,416 gas
 	function GTE() public pure returns (bool) {
  	// or could be <=
  	return 1 >= 2;
 	}

 	// 21,391 gas
 	function GT() public pure returns (bool) {
 	// or could be <
  	return 1 > 2;
 	}
   }


```
