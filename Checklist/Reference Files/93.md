### **Explanation** : 

The token only has one address. Some proxied tokens have multiple addresses. For example TUSD has two addresses.
Tokens with multiple entry points for balance updates can break internal bookkeeping based on the address
(e.g. balances[token_address][msg.sender] might not reflect the actual balance).
