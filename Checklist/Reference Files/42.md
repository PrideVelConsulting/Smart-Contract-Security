##  Write to storage last


---

### **Category Type** : GAS OPTIMIZATION


### **Explanation** : 

 Only update storage variables with the final results of your computation, after all intermediate calculations instead of at each step.
 This is because operations on storage is more expensive than operations on memory / calldata.
 Let’s look an example contract:


```javascript
 pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Test {
  uint internal count;

  function A() public {
  	for (uint i = 0; i < 10; i++){
      	count++; // Writes to storage at every intermediate step
  	}
  }

  function B() public {
  	uint j;
  	for (uint i = 0; i < 10; i++){
      	j++;
  	}
  	count = j; // Writes only the final result to storage
  }
}


```
In the sample code above, function B() is more gas-efficient than A() because it does less storage writes. Use local variables to store your intermediate results, and write to storage last.

Here is a cost comparison:

	SSTORE (saving a 32-byte word to storage): 22100 gas when storage value is set to non-zero from zero, OR 5000 gas when the storage value’s zeroness remains unchanged or is set to zero. This assumes first-time access.
	SLOAD (loading a word from storage): 2100 gas on first-time access, 100 gas if already accessed
	MSTORE (saving a word to memory): 3 gas
	MLOAD (loading a word from memory): 3 gas

As you can see, the difference is potentially massive. Minimize writes to storage and do them last. Note that are numbers are post-Berlin upgrade numbers (EIP 2929.)
