##    Flash Mintable tokens



---

### **Category Type** : QUALITY ASSURANCE / NON-CRITICAL


### **Explanation** : 

Flash-mintable tokens (FMTs) are ERC20-compliant tokens that allow flash minting: the ability for anyone to mint an arbitrary number of new tokens into their account,
as long as they also burn the same number of tokens from their account before the end of the same transaction.

Ensure if it is a flash mintable token that same proportion of token getting burnt as the amount of
Token getting minted in the same transaction
