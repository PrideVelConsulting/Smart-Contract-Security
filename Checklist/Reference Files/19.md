## 19) Use indexed events as they are less costly compared to non-indexed ones


---

### **Category Type** : GAS OPTIMIZATION


### **Explanation** :

Using the indexed keyword for value types such as uint, bool, and address saves gas costs, as seen in the example below. However, this is only the case for value types, whereas indexing bytes and strings are more expensive than their unindexed version.

```javascript

 //Unoptimized:
    
    event Withdraw(uint256, address);

	function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
	emit Withdraw(amount, msg.sender);
	}

    
    
//Optimized:
    
    event Withdraw(uint256 indexed, address indexed);

	function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
	emit Withdraw(amount, msg.sender);
	}



```
