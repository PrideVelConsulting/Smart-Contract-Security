## Use calldata instead of memory for function arguments that do not get mutated 


---

### **Category Type** : GAS OPTIMIZATION


### **Explanation** :

Mark data types as calldata instead of memory where possible. This makes it so that the data is not automatically   loaded into memory.
 If the data passed into the function does not need to be changed (like updating values in an array), it can be passed in as calldata. The one exception to this is if the argument must later be passed into another function that takes an argument that specifies memory storage.


It is generally cheaper to load variables directly from calldata, rather than copying them to memory. Only use memory if the variable needs to be modified.


```javascript
//Unoptimized:

function loop(uint[] memory arr) external pure returns (uint sum) {
	for (uint i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    	sum += arr[i];
	}
}



//Optimized:

function loop(uint[] calldata arr) external pure returns (uint sum) {
    for (uint i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        sum += arr[i];
    }
}

```
