##  Usage of uints/ints smaller than 32 bytes (256 bits) incurs overhead


---

### **Category Type** : GAS OPTIMIZATION


### **Explanation** : 

When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contractâ€™s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time.
Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.
