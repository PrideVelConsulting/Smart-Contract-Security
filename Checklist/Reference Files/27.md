## Refactor a modifier to call a local function instead of directly having the code in the modifier, saving bytecode size and thereby deployment cost


---

### **Category Type** : GAS OPTIMIZATION


### **Explanation** :
Modifiers code is copied in all instances where it's used, increasing bytecode size. By doing a refractor to the internal function, one can reduce bytecode size significantly at the cost of one JUMP. Consider doing this only if you are constrained by bytecode size.


```javascript
 //Unoptimized:
    
     modifier onlyOwner() {
   	 require(owner() == msg.sender, "Ownable: caller is not the owner");
   	 _;
 	}
    
// Optimized:
    
     modifier onlyOwner() {
   	 _checkOwner();
   	 _;
 	}

	function _checkOwner() internal view virtual {
   	require(owner() == msg.sender, "Ownable: caller is not the owner");  }


```
