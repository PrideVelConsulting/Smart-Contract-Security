##  Use unchecked for arithmetic where you are sure it won't over or underflow


---

### **Category Type** : GAS OPTIMIZATION


### **Explanation** : 

In the example below, the variable i cannot overflow because of the condition i < length, where length is defined as uint256.
The maximum value i can reach is max(uint)-1. Thus, incrementing i inside an unchecked block is safe and consumes less gas.


```javascript

function loop(uint256 length) public {
      	for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; ) {
        	// do something
       	unchecked {
        	i++;
        	}
      	}
     	}



```
