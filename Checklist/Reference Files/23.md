## Optimized packing of storage variables


---

### **Category Type** : GAS OPTIMIZATION


### **Explanation** :


  Pack variables in one slot by defining them in a lower data type.
    Packing only helps when multiple variables of the packed slot are being accessed in the same call.
    If not done correctly, it increases gas costs instead, due to shifts required.

```javascript
    	//Unoptimized:
    
	contract MyContract {
 	uint32  x; // Storage slot 0
 	uint256 y; // Storage slot 1
 	uint32  z; // Storage slot 2
}

    
	//Optimized:
    
   contract MyContract {
	uint32 x;  // Storage slot 0
	uint32 z;  // Storage slot 0
	uint256 y; // Storage slot 1
}


```
