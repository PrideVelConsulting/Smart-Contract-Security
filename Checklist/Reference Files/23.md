## 23) Donâ€™t make multiple updates to storage variables if possible


---

### **Category Type** : GAS OPTIMIZATION


### **Explanation** : 
Making many changes to storage data is expensive.
Making many changes to memory data on the stack is quite cheap - so you can use that as a temporary    variable, and then write to storage at the end.      

```javascript


   	pragma solidity >=0.8.4;

  	contract Example {
  	uint counter1;
  	uint counter2;

  	// 55,785 gas
	function Unoptimized() public {
	for(uint i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  	counter1++; // writes directly on storage 10 times
	}
	}

 	// 53,564 gas
    function Optimized() public {
 	uint tmpCounter = counter2;
	for(uint i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  	tmpCounter++; // updates stack data (cheap!) 10 times
	}
	counter2 = tmpCounter; // writes directly on storage once
  }
  }



```
