## Use selfdestruct to send eth


---

### **Category Type** : GAS OPTIMIZATION


### **Explanation** : 

 If the final thing your smart contract will ever do is send a remaining balance to an address, then instead of using send() or transfer(), it is cheaper in gas to use selfdestruct.
      
And after calling selfdestruct(), your smart contract will no longer be able to be used, use it with caution.
This is probably a useful trick for ‘codegolf’ style challenges but not useful in many practical situations.
      
Note: there used to be a refund when using selfdestruct, but this was removed in EIP-3529 (went live in London Ethereum update)  

```javascript
pragma solidity >=0.8.4;

contract Example {

  address who;
  constructor() payable {
	who = msg.sender;
  }
  // 34,785 gas
  function payEverythingWithTransfer() public  {
    	payable(who).transfer(address(this).balance);
  }

  // 32,567 gas
  function payEverythingWithSelfDestruct() public  {
    	selfdestruct(payable(who));
  }
}      
      


```
