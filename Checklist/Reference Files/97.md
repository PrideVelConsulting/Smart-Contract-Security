### **Category Type** : QUALITY ASSURANCE / NON-CRITICAL


### **Explanation** : 

Keep your contracts small and easily understandable. Single out unrelated functionality in other contracts or into libraries.  
General recommendations about source code quality of course apply: Limit the amount of local variables, the length of functions and so on.  
Document your functions so that others can see what your intention was and whether it is different than what the code does.
