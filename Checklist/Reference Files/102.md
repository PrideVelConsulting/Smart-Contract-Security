---

### **Category Type** : QUALITY ASSURANCE / NON-CRITICAL


### **Explanation** : 

There are many addresses and constants used in the system. It is recommended to put the most used ones in one file (for example constants.sol, use inheritance to access these values).

This will help with readability and easier maintenance for future changes.
