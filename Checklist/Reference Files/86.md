##  Approval Race Protections.



---

### **Category Type** : QUALITY ASSURANCE / NON-CRITICAL


### **Explanation** : 

Some tokens like USDT do not allow approving an amount M > 0 when an existing amount N > 0 is already approved.
This PR shows some in the wild problems caused by this issue. To prevent the issue discussed here,
Clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to 0 before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldnâ€™t enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before
