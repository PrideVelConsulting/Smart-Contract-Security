##     Floating Points and Precision   





   



---

### **Category Type** : MEDIUM/HIGH


### **Explanation** : 

As of this writing (Solidity v0.4.24), fixed point or floating point numbers are not supported.
This means that floating point representations must be made with the integer types in Solidity. This can lead to errors/vulnerabilities if not implemented correctly.
