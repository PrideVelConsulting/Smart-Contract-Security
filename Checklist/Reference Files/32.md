### **Explanation** : 


Ordering helps readers identify which functions they can call and to find the constructor and fallback definitions easier.


Functions should be grouped according to their visibility and ordered:

	* constructor

	* receive function (if exists)

	* fallback function (if exists)

	* external

	* public

	* internal

	* private
