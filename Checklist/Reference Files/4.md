## Cache array length outside of loop


---

### **Category Type** : GAS OPTIMIZATION


### **Explanation** :

 If not cached, the solidity compiler will always read the length of the array during each iteration.
 That is, if it is a storage array, this is an extra sload operation (100 additional extra gas for each iteration except for the first) and if it is a memory array, this is an extra mload operation (3 additional gas for each iteration except for the first).


```javascript

// 25402 gas  Unoptimized

function loopArray(uint256[] calldata ns) public returns (uint256 sum) {
    for(uint256 i = 0; i < ns.length;) {
        sum += ns[i];
        unchecked {
            i++;
        }
    }
}

```




```javascript

// 25182 gas (-230)  Optimized
function loopArray_cached(uint256[] calldata ns) public returns (uint256 sum) {
    uint256 length = ns.length;
    for(uint256 i = 0; i < length;) {
        sum += ns[i];
        unchecked {
            i++;
        }
    }
}

```

 Previously, every time before the condition was checked, the length of ns had to be fetched anew. We know the length wonâ€™t change during execution and we can reduce the number of ns.length calls to just 1 for a modest reduction in gas.
