### **Category Type** : QUALITY ASSURANCE / NON-CRITICAL


### **Explanation** : 

Though it is not mandatory criteria and depends upon use case, but do   
check this point or recommend it if the goal of the application can be equally achieved by transferring
Token in external wallet and not in the smart contract itself. The reason is obvious, that is there
greater probability of tokens getting stuck contract forever as compared to if transferred to
External account.
