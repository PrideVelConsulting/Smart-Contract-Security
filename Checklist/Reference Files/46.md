##  Byte constants are more efficient than string constants


---

### **Category Type** : GAS OPTIMIZATION


### **Explanation** : 

If data can fit into 32 bytes, then you should use bytes32 datatype rather than bytes or strings as it is cheaper in solidity.
   
   For Ex:

```javascript

   // Unoptimized:
   string public constant NAME = "Exchange";
   string public constant VERSION = "1.0";


   // Optimized:
   
   byte32 public constant NAME = "Exchange";
   byte32 public constant VERSION = "1.0";

```
