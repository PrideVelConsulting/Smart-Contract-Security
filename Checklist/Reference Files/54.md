### **Category Type** : QUALITY ASSURANCE / NON-CRITICAL


### **Explanation** : 

Privileged accounts can control families of tokens. One of the many arbitrary powers these accounts may have is blocking addresses.
The USDC and USDT properties are common examples of this behavior. In practice, this means that, upon being blocked, an account will not be allowed to transfer tokens.
Malicious or compromised token owners can trap funds in a contract by adding the contract address to the blocklist.
