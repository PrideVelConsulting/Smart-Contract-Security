## 2) Cache array length outside of loop


---

### **Category Type** : GAS OPTIMIZATION


### **Explanation** :

 If not cached, the solidity compiler will always read the length of the array during each iteration.
 That is, if it is a storage array, this is an extra sload operation (100 additional extra gas for each iteration except for the first) and if it is a memory array, this is an extra mload operation (3 additional gas for each iteration except for the first).


```javascript

// 25402 gas  Unoptimized

function loopArray(uint256[] calldata ns) public returns (uint256 sum) {
    for(uint256 i = 0; i < ns.length;) {
        sum += ns[i];
        unchecked {
            i++;
        }
    }
}

```




```javascript

// 25182 gas (-230)  Optimized
function loopArray_cached(uint256[] calldata ns) public returns (uint256 sum) {
    uint256 length = ns.length;
    for(uint256 i = 0; i < length;) {
        sum += ns[i];
        unchecked {
            i++;
        }
    }
}

```

 Previously, every time before the condition was checked, the length of ns had to be fetched anew. We know the length won’t change during execution and we can reduce the number of ns.length calls to just 1 for a modest reduction in gas.
