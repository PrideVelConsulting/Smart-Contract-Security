## 21) Payable functions are cheaper


---

### **Category Type** : GAS OPTIMIZATION


### **Explanation** : 

When Solidity is compiled, non payable functions get more opcodes to check ETH was not sent. So therefore, payable functions have cheaper gas ,and ofcourse it will depend on the use cases

```javascript
 pragma solidity >=0.8.4;
  	 
    	contract Example {
        	// 24,390 gas
     	function NotPayableFn() public {}
 
     	// 24,337 gas
    	function PayableFn() public payable {}
 
    	}

```
