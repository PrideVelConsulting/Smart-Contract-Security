## 1) array[index] += amount is cheaper than array[index] = array[index] + amount

### **Category Type** : GAS OPTIMIZATION


### **Explanation** :

 When updating a value in an array with arithmetic, using array[index] += amount is cheaper than array[index] = array[index] + amount.
 This is because you avoid an additional mload when the array is stored in memory, and an sload when the array is stored in storage.  This can be applied for any arithmetic operation including +=, -=,/=,*=,^=,&=, %=, <<=,>>=, and >>>=.   This optimization can be particularly significant if the pattern occurs during a loop.
