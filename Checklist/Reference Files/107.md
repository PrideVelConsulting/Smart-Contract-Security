### **Category Type** : QUALITY ASSURANCE / NON-CRITICAL


### **Explanation** : 
All Contracts

Description:

It is recommended that Solidity contracts are fully annotated using NatSpec for all public interfaces (everything in the ABI).
 It is clearly stated in the Solidity official documentation.
In complex projects such as Defi, the interpretation of all functions and their arguments and returns is important for code readability and auditability.
