## 55) DoS with block gas limit  


---

### **Category Type** : MEDIUM/HIGH


### **Explanation** : 

A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is an attempt to disrupt the normal functioning of a network, system, or service by overwhelming it with a flood of illegitimate requests or excessive computational tasks. In the context of a smart contract on a blockchain, a DoS attack aims to render the contract unusable or to consume an excessive amount of resources in the form of gas, causing disruption to the blockchain network itself.



**Here's an overview of how a DoS attack can be conducted on a smart contract and some preventive measures:**

    Gas Limit Exhaustion: Smart contracts on blockchains, such as Ethereum, utilize a concept called gas to measure and allocate computational resources. Each operation in a smart contract consumes a certain amount of gas, and users must pay for the gas they consume. An attacker can exploit this by creating a contract that requires an excessive amount of gas to execute, leading to a situation where legitimate users are unable to interact with the contract due to gas limitations. This attack is often referred to as a "gas limit exhaustion" attack.


**Prevention:**

To prevent gas limit exhaustion attacks, developers should carefully design and test their smart contracts to ensure that they have predictable and reasonable gas consumption. Additionally, setting appropriate gas limits for executing transactions and monitoring gas usage can help identify abnormal consumption patterns.
