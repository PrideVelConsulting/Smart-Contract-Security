## 24) Use ‘send’ instead of ‘transfer’


---

### **Category Type** : GAS OPTIMIZATION


### **Explanation** : 

If you use send instead of transfer, you can save gas as send does not check if it was successful.
(Of course this means you’re missing one of the key features of transfer, which is to know if it was successful. But if your only focus is gas saving, this can help a little)

Note: you might get compiler warnings, telling you that “Failure condition of ‘send’ ignored.
     
Consider using ‘transfer’ instead”. Be sure to understand the differences (other than gas) before you use it like this!
    

```javascript

 pragma solidity >=0.8.4;

	contract Example
    {
	address toPay;
	constructor() payable {
	toPay = msg.sender;
	}
 
	// 27,048 gas
   function paySomeoneWithTransfer() public payable {
    	payable(toPay).transfer(msg.value);
	}
 
 
            // 26,997 gas
    function paySomeoneWithSend() public payable {
    	payable(toPay).send(msg.value);
	}
   }



```
