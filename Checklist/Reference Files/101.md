##    Add a timelock to critical functions


   



---

### **Category Type** : QUALITY ASSURANCE / NON-CRITICAL


### **Explanation** : 

It is a good practice to give time for users to react and adjust to critical changes. A timelock provides more guarantees and reduces the level of trust required,
 thus decreasing risk for users.
4It also indicates that the project is legitimate (less risk of a malicious owner making a sandwich attack on a user).
