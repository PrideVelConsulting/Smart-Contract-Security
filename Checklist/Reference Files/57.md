## 57) Arithmetic Underflow/Overflow





---

### **Category Type** : MEDIUM/HIGH


### **Explanation** :

Arithmetic underflow and overflow are common vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts that arise when performing mathematical operations on unsigned integers without proper bounds checking. These vulnerabilities can lead to unexpected behavior, such as incorrect calculations or unintended state changes.

**Arithmetic Underflow:**

Arithmetic underflow occurs when the result of a subtraction operation goes below the minimum value representable by the data type being used. Solidity does not throw an exception in such cases but wraps around to the maximum value of the data type. This can lead to incorrect calculations or unexpected behavior.

**Example:**

```javascript

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract UnderflowExample {
    uint256 public minValue = 0;

    function subtract(uint256 _value) public {
        minValue -= _value;
    }
}

```

In this example, if _value is greater than minValue, an underflow will occur, and minValue will wrap around to its maximum value instead of throwing an error.

**Arithmetic Overflow:**

Arithmetic overflow occurs when the result of an addition operation exceeds the maximum value representable by the data type being used. Solidity also does not throw an exception in such cases but wraps around to the minimum value of the data type. This can lead to incorrect calculations or unintended state changes.

**Example:**

```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract OverflowExample {
    uint256 public maxValue = 2**256 - 1;

    function add(uint256 _value) public {
        maxValue += _value;
    }
}


```

In this example, if _value is such that adding it to maxValue exceeds the maximum value representable by uint256, an overflow will occur, and maxValue will wrap around to its minimum value instead of throwing an error.

*To prevent arithmetic underflow and overflow vulnerabilities, you can follow these best practices:*


    1. Bounds Checking: Always validate the input values and ensure that they are within acceptable bounds before performing arithmetic operations. Check if the subtraction or addition operation would result in underflow or overflow and handle such scenarios accordingly.

    2.  Use SafeMath Libraries: Utilize safe arithmetic libraries like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath or Solidity's built-in SafeMath library. These libraries provide secure arithmetic functions that prevent underflow and overflow vulnerabilities by performing explicit bounds checking before executing the operations.

*Example using SafeMath library:*

```javascript

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol";

contract SafeMathExample {
    using SafeMath for uint256;

    uint256 public minValue = 0;

    function subtract(uint256 _value) public {
        minValue = minValue.sub(_value);
    }
}


```

By using the SafeMath library's sub function, you ensure that the subtraction operation is performed safely, with bounds checking to prevent underflow.

    Data Type Selection: Choose appropriate data types with sufficient range to hold the expected values. For instance, if you know that a value will never exceed a certain limit, use a smaller data type that can accommodate the required range without encountering overflow issues.

By implementing these preventive measures, you can mitigate the risks associated with arithmetic underflow and overflow vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts and ensure the correctness and security of your contract's calculations.
