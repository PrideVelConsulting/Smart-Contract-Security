##    Entropy Illusion  




   



---

### **Category Type** : MEDIUM/HIGH


### **Explanation** :

All transactions on the Ethereum blockchain are deterministic state transition operations. Meaning that every transaction modifies the global state of the Ethereum
ecosystem and it does so in a calculable way with no uncertainty. This ultimately means that inside the blockchain ecosystem there is no source of entropy or randomness.
There is no rand() function in Solidity. Achieving decentralised entropy (randomness) is a well
established problem and many ideas have been proposed to address this (see for example, RandDAO or using a chain of Hashes as described by Vitalik in this post).
