##  25) Non-strict inequalities are cheaper than strict ones


---

### **Category Type** : GAS OPTIMIZATION


### **Explanation** : 

 In the EVM, there is no opcode for non-strict inequalities (>=, <=) and two operations are performed (> + =.) Consider replacing >= with the strict counterpart >


```javascript

// Before
require(value >= 2);

// After
require(value > 3);


```
