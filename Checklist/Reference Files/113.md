##  DoS with (unexpected) revert  


   



---

### **Category Type** : MEDIUM/HIGH


### **Explanation** : 

DoS (denial-of-service) attacks can occur in functions when you try to send funds to a user and the functionality relies on that fund transfer being successful.

This can be problematic in the case that the funds are sent to a smart contract created by a bad actor, since they can simply create a fallback function that reverts all payments.
