##  uint256 can be cheaper than uint8


---

### **Category Type** : GAS OPTIMIZATION


### **Explanation** : 


When using types that are smaller than 32 bytes such as uint8, your contractâ€™s gas usage may in some cases be higher than if you use uint256.
  This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. The EVM will still occupy 256 bits, fill 8 bits with the uint variable and fill the extra bites with zeros.
  Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM has to do more operations to convert the element between 32 bytes and the desired size.

  It might be beneficial to use smaller-size types if you can get the compiler to pack multiple types into one storage slot (see the previous section on Variable packing),
  and thus, combine multiple reads or writes into a single operation.
  However, if you are not reading or writing all the values at the same time, this can have the opposite effect.
  When defining a lone variable, it can be more optimal to use a uint256 rather than uint8.
