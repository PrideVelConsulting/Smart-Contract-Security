### **Category Type** : QUALITY ASSURANCE / NON-CRITICAL


### **Explanation** : 

a pausable ERC20 token is a token that can be paused to prevent any transfers of the token when it is paused.
This is very useful when you are doing something like an Initial Coin Offering (ICO).
Seeing your token pop up on an exchange before the ICO is over can have devastating effects on your token sale and in a lot of projects,
 has been a make it or break it point.  

So sometimes, the token owner/creator implement  pausable ERC20 token feature in the ERC20.
But the drawback is now the Admin has full control and he can use it to his own advantages. In short, this can make that token less decentralized.
So , do check or recommend this point to client in the case of design their ERC20 tokens.
It can be coded either via custom coding or using OZ libraries.
