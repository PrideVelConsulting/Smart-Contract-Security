## Avoid contract existence checks by using low level calls


---

### **Category Type** : GAS OPTIMIZATION


### **Explanation** : 

Prior to 0.8.10 the compiler inserted extra code, including EXTCODESIZE (100 gas), to check for contract existence for external function calls.
 In more recent solidity versions, the compiler will not insert these checks if the external call has a return value.
 Similar behavior can be achieved in earlier versions by using low-level calls, since low level calls never check for contract existence
