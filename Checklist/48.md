##   Using storage instead of memory for structs/arrays saves gas


---

### **Category Type** : GAS OPTIMIZATION


### **Explanation** : 

When fetching data from a storage location, assigning the data to a memory variable causes all fields of the struct/array to be read from storage,
which incurs a Gcoldsload (2100 gas) for each field of the struct/array. If the fields are read from the new memory variable,
 they incur an additional MLOAD rather than a cheap stack read. Instead of declearing the variable with the memory keyword,
 declaring the variable with the storage keyword and caching any fields that need to be re-read in stack variables, will be much cheaper,
 only incuring the Gcoldsload for the fields actually read. The only time it makes sense to read the whole struct/array into a memory variable,
 is if the full struct/array is being returned by the function,
 is being passed to a function that requires memory, or if the array/struct is being read from another memory array/struct
