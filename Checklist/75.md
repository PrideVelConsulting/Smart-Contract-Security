##  Unchecked External Call




---

### **Category Type** : QUALITY ASSURANCE / NON-CRITICAL


### **Explanation** : 

Solidity low-level call methods (e.g., address.call()) do not throw an exception. Instead, they return false if the call encounters an exception.
On the other hand, contract calls (e.g., ExternalContract.doSomething()) automatically propagate a throw if doSomething() throws.
Transferring Ether using addr.send()is a good example where unsuccessful transfers should be handled explicitly by checking the return value,
but this is also valid for other external calls.
