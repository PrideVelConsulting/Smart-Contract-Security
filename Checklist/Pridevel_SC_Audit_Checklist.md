# Pridevel's Smart Contracts Auditing Checklist

### **Description** :  This is  quick set of condensed checkpoints for your reference to perform security audit and gas optimized version of any smart contract

Initial Tips before you start following this checklist :

* Though you can follow any order ,and their is no strict rule as such .but we recommend you to check for **GAS OPTIMIZATION**
 ,then **LOW RISK/QA** ,and at the end look for **MEDIUM/HIGH** risk issues






### Severity Categorization
---

#### Estimating Risk

Where assets refer to funds, NFTs, data, authorization, and any information intended to be private or confidential:


**QA (Quality Assurance)**  Includes both Non-critical (code style, clarity, syntax, versioning, off-chain monitoring (events, etc) and Low risk (e.g. assets are not at risk: state handling, function incorrect as to spec, issues with comments). Excludes Gas optimizations, which are submitted and judged separately.

**2 — Med**: Assets not at direct risk, but the function of the protocol or its availability could be impacted, or leak value with a hypothetical attack path with stated assumptions, but external requirements.

**3 — High**: Assets can be stolen/lost/compromised directly (or indirectly if there is a valid attack path that does not have hand-wavy hypotheticals).




> NOTE:  For both medium and high risk issues , there are 15-20 common types of attacks vectors we have to look for. If we find via certain behavior ,or attack vector that it is impacting specific user  at extreme hypothetical random condition,we will keep that in “Medium” Category.
If it affects the main vault,or will impact all the users ,or its access mechanism ,we should put it as high.
So, in PVL category checklist,we would be keeping all  those common attack vectors in category “Med/HIGH”
